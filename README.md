git-vogue
=========

git-vogue make your Haskell git repositories fashionable.

We all know that we *should* be using tools like [hlint][1] and [Stylish Haskell][2], but how often do you really do it? git-vogue makes it trivial to do the right thing, set it up once then reap the benefits forever.
